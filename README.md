# LinTeX

A linter for LaTeX, powered by [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

## Roadmap

Be aware that this is a wish list and not maybe not everything will actually happen.

- [x] PoC: Output an error based on a violation in a parsed file.
- [ ] Follow `\include` and `\input` to parse complete documents instead of raw files.
- [ ] Provide a convenient way to configure.
- [ ] Provide an interface for user provided rules.
